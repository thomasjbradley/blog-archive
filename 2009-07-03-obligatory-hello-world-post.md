# Obligatory Hello World Post

**An introduction to my new site, a quick overview of what it’s all about and a sample of the exciting things to come.**

**Welcome to the new thomasjbradley.ca!** It’s pretty frakin’ amazing, eh? Well it should be, it took me a good two years of re-designing and re-coding to build—but more on that soon.

This is just one of those quick posts that every new blog *must* have, so I can tell you what this web site is about—though I’m pretty sure you already know.

Here’s the official description:

> Thomas J Bradley makes web sites that are elegant, simple & absolutely super-duper!

**Whoa, this site’s about me!**

Now something a little more interesting. What the blog is about, represented by another official description:

> Articles, essays and tips & tricks on topics including web development, web education and Canadiana.

## Under Construction

The site is, unfortunately, not complete. Though after two years you’d think it would be! I had wanted to launch with three blog posts, but was so excited to launch my site I thought I would write them over the next three days.

There are a few other things I would like to do, but this site will be more of an ongoing project instead of a make-it-and-leave-it type deal like version one-point-zero.

Since everything is official today, here is the *official* list of incomplete things (which will get done in the next few days), copied directly from the text file on my desktop.

- <del>Lab project pages</del> <ins class="time">Completed August 27, 2009</ins>

**Oh, and a bazillion other details.**

Anyways, I think that’s all. Let me know what you think of the site! Hopefully you love it as much as I do.
